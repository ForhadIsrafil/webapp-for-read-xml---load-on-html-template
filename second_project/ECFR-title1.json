Direct costs include, for\n                                        example, the salary of the employee performing the work (the basic rate of pay\n                                        for the employee, plus 16 percent of that rate to cover benefits) and the cost\n                                        of operating duplication machinery.

For this purpose, the term\n                                        \u201cnews\u201d means information that is about current events or that would be of\n                                        current interest to the public. Examples of news-media entities are television\n                                        or radio stations broadcasting to the public at large and publishers of\n                                        periodicals (but only if such entities qualify as disseminators of \u201cnews\u201d) who\n                                        make their products available for purchase by or subscription by or free\n                                        distribution to the general public. These examples are not all-inclusive.\n                                        Moreover, as methods of news delivery evolve (for example, the adoption of the\n                                        electronic dissemination of newspapers through telecommunications services),\n                                        such alternative media shall be considered to be news-media entities. A\n                                        freelance journalist shall be regarded as working for a news-media entity if the\n                                        journalist can demonstrate a solid basis for expecting publication through that\n                                        entity, whether or not the journalist is actually employed by the entity. A\n                                        publication contract would present a solid basis for such an expectation; the\n                                        agency may also consider the past publication record of the requester in making\n                                        such a determination. To qualify under this category, a requester must not be\n                                        seeking the requested records for a commercial use. A request for records\n                                        supporting the news-dissemination function of the requester will not be\n                                        considered to be for a commercial use.",
                              "(7) \u201cReview\u201d means the examination of a record located in response to a request\n                                        in order to determine whether any portion of it is exempt from disclosure. It\n                                        also includes processing any record for disclosure - for example, doing all that\n                                        is necessary to redact it and prepare it for disclosure. Review costs are\n                                        recoverable even if a record ultimately is not disclosed. Review time includes\n                                        time spent considering any formal objection to disclosure made by a business\n                                        submitter under \u00a7 304.7 but does not include time spent resolving general legal\n                                        or policy issues regarding the application of exemptions.",
                              "(8) \u201cSearch\u201d means the process of looking for and retrieving records or\n                                        information responsive to a request. It includes page-by-page or line-by-line\n                                        identification of information within records and also includes reasonable\n                                        efforts to locate and retrieve information from records maintained in electronic\n                                        form or format. The agency will conduct searches in the most efficient and least\n                                        expensive manner reasonably possible. For example, it will not search on a\n                                        line-by-line basis where duplicating an entire document would be quicker and\n                                        less expensive.",

                              "(B) The disclosure must contribute to the understanding of a reasonably broad\n                                        audience of persons interested in the subject, as opposed to the individual\n                                        understanding of the requester. A requester's expertise in the subject area as\n                                        well as the requester's ability and intention to convey information effectively\n                                        to the public will be considered.

To determine whether disclosure of the requested information is\n                                        primarily in the commercial interest of the requester, the agency will consider\n                                        the following criteria:",

A commercial interest includes any commercial, trade,\n                                        or profit interest. Requesters will be given an opportunity to provide\n                                        explanatory information regarding this consideration.",
                              "(B) Whether any identified commercial interest is the primary interest furthered\n                                        by the request. A waiver or reduction of fees is justified when the requirements\n                                        of paragraphs (k)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section are satisfied and any\n                                        commercial interest is not the primary interest furthered by the request. The\n                                        agency ordinarily will presume that when a news media requester has satisfied\n                                        factors in paragraphs (k)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section, the request is not\n                                        primarily in the commercial interest of the requester. Disclosure to data\n                                        brokers or others who merely compile and market government information for\n                                        direct economic return will not be presumed primarily to serve the public\n                                        interest.",
                              "(3) Where only some of the records to be released satisfy the requirements for a\n                                        waiver of fees, a waiver will be granted for those records.",
                              "(4) Requests for a waiver or reduction of fees should ordinarily be made when the\n                                        request is first submitted to the agency and should address the criteria\n                                        referenced above. A requester may submit a fee waiver request at a later time so\n                                        long as the underlying record request is pending or on administrative appeal.\n                                        When a requester who has committed to pay fees subsequently asks for a waiver of\n                                        those fees and that waiver is denied, the requester must pay any costs incurred\n                                        up to the date the fee waiver request was received."

The disclosure of information that already is in the public domain, in\n                                    either a duplicative or a substantially identical form, is not likely to contribute\n                                    to an understanding of government operations and activities because this information\n                                    is already known.",

The disclosure must contribute to the understanding of a reasonably\n                                    broad audience of persons interested in the subject, as opposed to the individual\n                                    understanding of the Requester. A Requester's expertise in the subject area and\n                                    ability and intention to effectively convey information to the public shall be\n                                    considered.

The public's understanding of\n                                    the subject in question must be enhanced by the disclosure to a significant extent,\n                                    as compared to the level of public understanding existing prior to the disclosure.\n                                    The NCPC shall not make value judgments about whether information that would\n                                    contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of\n                                    the government is important enough to be made public.",

The NCPC shall consider any commercial interest of the\n                                    Requester (with reference to the definition of Commercial Use Request in \u00a7\n                                    602.3(f)), or of any person on whose behalf the Requester may be acting, that would\n                                    be furthered by the Requested disclosure. Requesters shall be given an opportunity\n                                    in the administrative process to provide explanatory information regarding this\n                                    consideration.",
                          "(2) Whether any identified commercial interest of the Requester is sufficiently large\n                                    in comparison with the public interest in disclosure that disclosure is primarily in\n                                    the commercial interest of the Requester. A Fee Waiver is justified where the public\n                                    interest standard of paragraph (b) of this section is satisfied and that public\n                                    interest is greater in magnitude than that of any identified commercial interest in\n                                    disclosure. The NCPC ordinarily shall presume that a Representative of the News\n                                    Media satisfies the public interest standard, and the public interest will be the\n                                    interest primarily served by disclosure to that Requester. Disclosure to data\n                                    brokers or others who merely compile and market government information for direct\n                                    economic return shall not be presumed to primarily serve the public interest.",
